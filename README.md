# SMART Bin for High-Density Residential Areas
> Intelligent standalone residential compost gas generator that effectively manages household waste and produces biogas. Its novelty lies in the fully automatic, no-touch, no-spillage garbage collection system, integrated with IoT features for real-time monitoring and alerts. This system also reuses wastewater for biogas generation, creating an autonomous and eco-friendly solution for urban waste management.
## 🚀 Overview

India generates over 960 million tons of solid waste annually. This project addresses waste segregation, automation, and biogas production using a smart IoT-enabled system suitable for dense residential areas.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate lid access, fill detection, and waste segregation
- Convert wet waste into usable biogas
- Monitor system health and notify stakeholders
- Support SDGs 3, 6, 7, 11, 13
